we're gonna do I think it is time to get started so I'm gonna bring Sarah on to the stage there she is what's going on Sarah yeah thanks for having me I'm so excited that this actually worked out and that we get to learn from you today and as you know your talk was uh officially supposed to start four minutes ago so I'm just gonna go ahead and jump off stage and I'll be back in like 20 25 minutes awesome thanks so much hey everybody very very excited to be here today hoping to share with you some of the amazing use cases that allow us to see how business users are thinking of using large language models in production uh specifically in the context of intelligent assistance so I'm at Salesforce I lead a team of machine learning engineers and data scientists and so very excited to bring to you today the work that we've been doing and what you'll be seeing from us going forward now I have to start every talk by reminding you that Salesforce is a publicly traded company and so if you are indeed a customer or thinking to make a purchasing decision please do that off of products and services that are currently available as this may be very forward-looking content that you're seeing here today all right let's give it a go so no surprise to everyone here uh but of course generative AI is dominating all of our headlines and while to many it may have seemed like much of a buzzword there is absolute consensus that this is a game changer it's the type of revolution in Tech that we haven't seen in the last two decades really there have been several that have come along but this one is really a game changer with far-reaching opportunities a lot of benefits that we can see here and of course risks um like Demetrios called out around things like hallucinations what we're seeing is that companies of every size in every industry are really racing to understand how they can use generative AI to help propel them into the future Now by no means is this necessarily a brand new Journey AI has been here for quite some time Salesforce of course has been working on this space for a very very long time but there is just a ton of pressure to make sure that with AI you can meet your customers expectations so in the past there were opportunities for customers to believe that it's acceptable for long response times there's absolutely those days are gone customers expect for you to respond to them with speed um that it is seamless in the communication that you are available of course they also now assume that you need to have personalized content it used to feel like one size fits all and you could kind of get something close to what you wanted but today customers really expect you to anticipate your needs 62 of the ones uh surveyed have this expectation at this point and of course all the time consuming tasks the expectation is that everything should be convenient and automation of tasks needs to be present so what we have really is a change where AI is no longer a nice to have it is truly the expectation that AI power tools are going to be a standard for helping shorten your response time personalizing those experience and eliminating these very time consuming tasks that could indeed be automated now while those are the expectations there is absolutely still a gap so 70 76 of execs they say they still struggle to deploy I am production is actually staggering to hear how often products that are projects that are worked on don't make it into production and there's several reasons for that everything from data limitations and quality so if you bring in garbage data of course that's what you get out there are integration challenges so companies need to figure out how to bring all that data together make sure they're connected and of course making sure that all of your processes can plug into these new tech so for Salesforce we have really been in this space for quite some time and I myself have been on this journey with cell source for uh coming up on seven years here so what's exciting is that Salesforce has always been thinking about how to make it easy to democratize AI truly making sure that everyone has access to AI as they are using Salesforce in order to improve those customer touch points and making them more intelligent what we've done at Salesforce is today we ship 1 trillion predictions a day or sorry one trillion predictions a week which is kind of Staggering when you think about it these are everything from opportunity scores uh to being able to you know predict a label for a case for classifying it for triage what this ensures is that you're able to convert leads faster for lead scoring for service Cloud you can have on average a 27 reduction in support costs by using Einstein design and bots in marketing we see an increase in engagement for emails and in Commerce of course product recommendations allow major uplift um we knew nearly a decade ago that AI was going to be extremely important and so we invested in in-house research um today we have over 200 200 AI research papers published and over uh 200 AI patents we acquired um different AI innovators along the way everything from relayed IQ and prediction i o and metamind and of course we developed a lot of Technology in-house I myself was able to work on the Automated machine learning technology different forecasting methods and of course multiple large language models the llms what I think is so exciting now is aside from the world and the journey that we've been on for democratizing AI I truly believe that at this moment we are seeing massive democratization of AI by these large language models by putting them into the hands of every developer even my aunt is using them to try them out and to see what is possible and the unlock that comes with that of course is everyone is able to Envision how to make their lives easier how to be assisted by AI in order to move faster but of course with all of that uh there are still a lot of things that you have to consider so while it leaders believe that generative AI is a business priority and they absolutely need to fast track it and we do believe it's a game changer and we'll transform the customer relationship management the analytics and help automate parts of the business there is still a lot of concern like Demetrios pointed out there are some risks around security around trust bias misinformation the inaccuracies that come with hallucinations and companies are worried about how their data is going to be used that everything is done in a secure way and of course for Salesforce that is front and center how can we put this technology into the hands of our customers and ensure that it is completely secure and that they can safely deploy this new tech so for that we have Einstein GPT that is the world's first generative AI for CRM it allows sales teams to reach out marketers to create landing pages and developers can write code so I'm really excited to be able to show you some demos that we've recorded for you just to make sure that we don't have any Tech Ledges here of what it is that we're working on um so that you can really see the art of the possible and think about how the work that you may be doing could be changed every day now I do want to pause and talk a little bit about our architecture because of course it's very important to think through how it is that we are building this um so we did announce earlier this week just on Monday our AI Cloud um it is this complete and unified architecture um of course everything is grounded in trust so we are starting on hyperforce which is our trusted infrastructure that is secure and compliant and on top of it we have our platform that gives low code tools to developers to build out uh then above that we have our large language models you can see it's embedded into our platform and what it does is it allows us to offer it then to our Builders who are then able to construct apps on this very secure layer and of course then we ship our own apps which are going to be the ones that I'm going to be highlighting for you so very excited to talk to you about how we can think about this going forward now I'm just going to take a brief detour to make very clear how we think about trust and how we're putting that first um so we do Focus heavily on making sure there are controls in place to make sure that we are able to leverage customer data so customer it's their data and they can use it but we also want to make sure that the trust is built in and so we have various various components that we were putting in place that allow the secure retrieval and the use the masking toxicity detection so that we can deploy so our customers can deploy these powerful tools but feel that there is complete trust that it stays within our boundary of trust all right let's get to the use cases so this is about how llms can be intelligent assistance so let's take a brief pause and for those of you that aren't as familiar with Salesforce um customer relationship management is really all of the touch points that you have with your customers whether it's in sales where we're working to be able to close deals Faster by helping create emails generate them uh service where it's about how can I when a customer service interaction is happening resolve faster any request for marketers to be able to to create more content that is more personalized and more relevant in Commerce when you're building ways to be able to interact with those customers to make it faster to generate product descriptions and of course in I.T to be able to develop faster to be able to write code we have our force.com platform that allows our customers to be able to build applications on top of our platforms as well all right with no further Ado I'm about to take you through a tour of the types of products that we are building um all right so we're going to start off in a sales use case um we have a seller who's in the Salesforce experience here and on their home page um seeing that a new account was transferred so they go ahead and ask can I learn more about my new account here Outreach and love would love to see any recent news so the Einstein assistant is going to create a summary using available data and points out as well that hey outscape has some expansion in the US market it pulls up a lightweight description there on the left and offers you the opportunity to update that description so this allows the Salesforce data to be kept fresh with information making it easy for the user to update as they see necessary now since the news is there about the expansion and my role here is as a seller I'd love to learn more and that's being offered to me so here we see that we're presented with two individuals that are involved in this expansion some of them are not yet in Salesforce and so we are able to go ahead and create the contact directly again from this assistant in another case Mia who's leading this expansion I have the opportunity to compose an email so with large language models we are able to ground the information and create a personalized and relevant email reaching out to Mia now we can edit it or we can actually also ask Einstein's assistant to make it a little bit shorter for us so am I getting a little bit less formal is the first request that we'll go ahead and make we can see that we're presented with a new version that we can go ahead and edit live there um I'd also love to actually send a link to Mia so that I can connect with her live in slack so we go ahead and ask for that to be created in a private Channel and add it on to that email what's so powerful is how this is all in the flow of work you're able to draft an email make any edits that you want but you can also go ahead and send once you're satisfied with it so it's that easy very efficient the assistant is helping you get through this task quickly now Salesforce other product of Tableau um actually the goal here is to allow the assistant assistive technology to be able to generate actual analytics for you so asking how outscope is performing we see that we are able to see a summary of the graph that is also the chart that's being generated for us there and I love the call outs of the colors that can actually happen down below we see that relevant other related charts are being presented other dashboards that you can click on and of course you can Mouse over and see all of the individual uh portions of that dashboard that are interesting to Mouse over all right let's hop on over into service we've all interact with customer service Representatives here's an example where somebody's coming in and asking about the temperature rating of K3 Alpine jacket so um we see that we are offered a reply that of course we can edit fantastic so it's retrieving relevant information and making sure that we can with the request for night skiing and the temperature rating Now understand what else we would like to provide back so what's powerful about this is that as the requests are happening we're we're getting recommended replies that are using knowledge articles and content at the end it can even help me create a summary for closing the case and what's super powerful about is you also can create knowledge articles that can now be shared again this is generated off of that conversation in the replies and can now be used to share with the rest of the team so that the next team member that has to answer similar cases can handle it all right another part of customer relationship management is marketing so here we're going to take a case where um this company nto is creating a campaign um so we're here trying to set up a new campaign and again we're going to use the assistant in order to build out a page so we're going to go ahead and say that we're going to create a landing page and it's for a VIP opening at the Park City store for nto so on the left we can see that there is a page that's created with it we have experience Builder where you can go in and edit but actually we can continue editing it right here in the assistant so we'll start off by again asking for a campaign message to be generated pretty great gotta also say that we can add it on to the left but it's um maybe looking a little wordy there for us um so we'll make it a little bit shorter again we see this generated content you can always go ahead and add it and edit it as you please but it's allowing us to iterate enough a lot faster so it turns out that we have the opportunity to meet the US Olympic team so we can add that into the content as well and this iterative nature where we can both edit but ask the assistant allows me to move a lot faster so we're going to even generate an image for the header it's winter time so we're going to go ahead and change it make it a little bit snowy all right and then what other touches do we want let's add a title let's add a form [Music] it's pretty incredible uh all of all of this experience is something that will really allow our users to move a lot faster they can of course open an experience Builder and make edits there but they can also just go ahead and publish and so the level of efficiency that is gained is truly dramatic truly remarkable last but not least our developers um we have the ability to also assist right here um while we are writing our code so we've been asked to create a controller um to be able to retrieve contacts um so what we're going to do is go ahead and write some comments what's great is it's giving us the autocomplete the the hinting so we're going to create a method to list contacts with name and contact information we're going to limit the query to 10 records I'm continuing to do the SMART common tinting which is fantastic we have lightning components that we want um this to be invocable from and with that commenting boom we're actually able to get the code what's really powerful about that is it's actually doing everything that we asked for it's making it invocable with that decorator we see that it's selecting all of the fields it's making sure that it's creating that right limit and this can now be available but of course we need to test it in order to ensure that we're confident with the code that we're deploying and so in addition to being able to generate code well it turns out we can also generate test scaffolding um so let's go ahead and take a look at how that might work so right now uh we're again going ahead to write code but starting with our comments so let's start by typing that we would like to create the tests for contact controller again hinting there happening for us um and what's powerful about this is again we're learning while we're doing so we can see that that scaffolding is just generated for us it allows our allows developers to be thinking about how they're working of course any edit that they need to make can be happening right here but it really again allows it assists in being much more efficient so you can see how everything is available to us really a game changer for for our customers here now I know we went through that pretty quickly so going to highlight a few of those again um we started earlier talking about all the different parts of the customer relationship management platform that we have so again with sales GPT we're really focusing on how to sell faster and thinking again how the llms and what has happened with making it so available how it's been so much easier to Think Through what sort of increase in productivity we can get by unleashing this AI for our sales context um of course we also have service that we mentioned that service experience again how can we accelerate the resolution of any cases with AI as an assistant to move faster um help make your customers much more satisfied and making sure that there's a lot more efficiency unlocked so we saw how we were able to be assisted in the responses to any requests that were coming grounded in the information that is available in CRM for that individual customer and of course then generating more knowledge to make it more efficient and speed us up as we go forward and then lastly we saw marketing uh it's pretty exciting to see how we could create some campaigns quickly everything from the image generation down to the content and making it as easy as possible to create anything that we like right in that experience around text and around images and accelerating the time to be able to publish it all right well that actually completes my Whirlwind tour the goal really was to show all of the different places in the context of customer relationship management where we are able to accelerate and help our customers better serve and interact with their customers so hopefully that really unlocked uh some ideas for you all and shows the art of the possible and really what sort of differentiation we can get out of bringing this to the to everyone so awesome thank you so much Sarah so there's some cool questions that are coming through in the chat and I want to ask him real fast uh we are on a bit of a delay so like we talk right now and then people see us in 20 seconds so I think that I'll ask you the first question and then by that time more questions will have come through and uh you are awesome on timing which is you were you're the clock today and that's great you're making my job easy so question for Sarah what was the input for the analytics demo data in rdbms ah so one really important thing about Salesforce is um customers use that platform and it is their data so everything is per tenant separated every organization and so we have a product Tableau customers are able to access data securely have access to their data and I really encourage you to check out um Tableau to learn more about it both in terms of where the data can be that is being accessed and of course how you can also rely on data that's stored in Salesforce to be able to access it in a variety of different places including tableau so cool so another one that came up is how is the input form created is it selecting from some pre-programmed set of available forms or is it the llm generating code for the form if the later is there any validation of the generated code for the landing page example ah the landing page example yeah so um a lot of this again thing that are commonly used and generated I really again encourage you to check out marketing cloud and the platforms that we have a lot of what we're showing here is a combination of data that's available in Salesforce so again looking at for example a sales example where you're able to ground in the data that is stored in Salesforce and then of course there's the work that the team is putting together on being able to generate the right prompts and being able to make sure that that data is available and secured and primitive for use of course so Salesforce actually has a lot of great control and the ability to generate content from that data that's available but only your own data and only really um sort of with a human in the loop since that is a very very critical part of everything that we're building yeah so uh there's there's also awesome questions coming through here and I have uh one that I want to ask just to selfishly because in the report that we created a few people were talking about how what they're thinking about with llms is where do we augment someone's workflow and where do we completely replace it and I imagine you've been thinking deeply about that for the past whatever seven or ten years so how do you look at those trade-offs yeah for Salesforce um [Music] but so so critical and especially as you rightly pointed out in the beginning making sure that everything that is being generated is accurate making sure that it is reviewed making sure that it can be trusted um and this is true for our Pro our generative products but of course it's also very very true to your point for the AI models that we've been shipping for quite some time so with that aside from putting you know with the the builders that we showed um in in that graph that really allow our customers to build again models on their own data with just a few clicks um it's very important for us to also have that explainability element where they can go and check the reports check for an understanding of what data is driving the predictions and how accurate those are and even at the individual predictions having explainability so the the import of the importance of humans in the loop cannot be understated because they are truly what we're showing are assistance they're assisting in making us more efficient they're assisting and helping us think and bring in more context so that indeed the right decisions are made edits can be made but it still is a process of speeding up of prioritizing work that is the the main differentiator and putting aside kind of maybe the repetitive tasks of in the service case needing to search knowledge articles and look for it well what if we can just surface them of course that's still there of course they're going to be very complex use cases and requests that are coming in but wherever possible to leverage what's available in your knowledge articles that are created um and then the multiplier that you saw of even generating new knowledge articles um but still with the human in the loop that curates and and make sure that you know everything is true trusted and tried yeah that is so awesome and it's a sometimes it can get a little bit sticky like you don't know is this good enough is the technology good enough right now to fully say we can trust this and Trust the output nine times out of ten or ten times out of ten if it's a very very important use case right and uh and so I think that's awesome one last question for you before we jump because it's been like a few people in the chat have been like yes plus one to this question plus one please and I know Salesforce I've talked to actually a few people at Salesforce before and I know how serious you take customer data and the privacy of data so uh Brahma is asking can you comment how you're keeping the customer data private private and especially this me talking now there are so many ways for these llms to kind of leak data and talk about different um data that maybe you don't want out there so how are you thinking about that and I think there was a whole layer where you're like catching things before when I looked at the stack yeah absolutely so one one very important thing to understand is everything that Salesforce does is focused around making sure that customer data is secure um so your data is yours your data is not our products um everything that we do is precisely to avoid that um so going back again to the AI products that we build like the builders it is on your data it is only your data built by you um and that's so so critical in order to make sure that um you know for the reasons of trust and also for the reasons of relevance all that matters is really your data and the signals in your data um so this is how Salesforce focuses on it by keeping data separate by building models for customers on their data because it is really their product that they are building and we are offering a platform and tools to make that possible in a way that is fully secure and maintaining Trust there was a lot of focus I encourage you to watch back our AI day where we really go deep on how it is that we're doing that and preventing exactly what you describe your customer your data it's not being retained to train and fine-tune models that is not the goal the goal is to make sure that we can ground in the data that you have retrieve relevance and then make sure that we are able to generate content that is hyper relevant to you awesome so good well Sarah thank you so much for coming on here I'm so glad that this worked out this was like yeah it made my made my whole conference that you were able to do this and I really appreciate you showing us uh what you're up to at Salesforce and how you're thinking about things especially in this new llm paradigm world and how you can incorporate that into products so thank you so much thanks for having me really appreciate it we'll see you later [Music]
