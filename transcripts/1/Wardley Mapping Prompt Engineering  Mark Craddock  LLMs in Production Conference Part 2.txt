[Music] oh nice it's awesome that's a great shout out I hallucinate more than chat gbt shirt uh all right well I'm gonna give you the floor and share your slides thanks so much cool right I guess everybody can hear me so I'll I'll talk about worldly mapping and problems engineering so for those who don't know what modeling mapping is I'll just quickly whiz for it but I'll I'll share some links at the end so you can you can go and do some more research yourself so here's a strategic planning tool um you know for around your business and services it was created by Simon wardley um so you can find him on Twitter and it helps you kind of visualize and understand the structure your business and the uh and but you know based on based on user username so a map kind of this is an empty map it looks like this so on the left-hand side you have the Genesis on the right hand side you have Commodities and basically all technology moves from the left to the map to the right of the map um some things can take you know 40 years so if we take think about Computing you know originally there was no uh it was you know research it was mechanical and now you received over time you know Computing is turned into a utility so um it's the the world map is based around the user needs so it's the anchor so it starts with you know the needs of the user um it use you create a value chain so the links between the dependencies between the components um and your map and this is the the kind of flow of capital so the flow of capital could be money it could be other things it could be trust um and basically everything starts with your user needs and then kind of flows down through that value chain and you kind of add all the individual components so in this case you know like large language models Cloud chunking text Splitters and we'll see that in a minute and basically you know you've got that evolution of the map from left to right from Genesis custom product utility and you know the purpose of the market map is to help you make uh decision making but it's also a good age for you know particular markets um looking at kind of industry challenges and changes and also improving strategic decisions and it helps with that kind of shared contact so when you talk about your strategy within the organization it helps you kind of share that and understand it across all your members so and the key thing we'll talk about a bit better is about strategic decision making and it helps you know kind of build a buy choices where should you invest where should you focus your your thing it also helps anticipate change and because the world changes all the time the map needs to change you need to keep it iterated and keep it updated um and it gives you a lens to also look at your competitors as well and we'll do a bit of that so this is a very big map it's very complicated it covers prompt engineering and we'll kind of just talk through it step by step uh later you'll get the slides I'll I'll tweet them anyway but you can have a look at this map and play with yourself um and you can also map uh represent the map using uh the code so the kind of worldly mapping code and this code can also be put into chat GDP and chat GDP understands this map and it can help you build the map it can challenge you on the map and it it's a good way of um giving the context to chat GTP so it understands the links between the components it understands the components and then from that you can you know you can create an additional Maps or support with the maps um and there's a separate tweet tweak tweet thread on that so getting to prompt engineering um so with this map you know we can anticipate change understand where to invest understand technical debt or the risk of testing a bit and understand kind of where to build or buy um and you know also if we map the capital flow we can understand our kind of cost per transactions within our um living on map so the the capital flow flows in both directions so it can be your financial investment you know the kind of Revenue you get from the public using your services and that kind of return on investment you can calculate it so you can calculate the cost between each component and the cost that one transaction so you know going into your your app or whatever and making those queries like all the way down for the llms and back so um this you know starting at the top of that we start with the user needs in this case as a prompt engineer and we've got various different use cases so and I've simplified this version of a map just so it makes it easier to talk for it but if we look at the kind of questions and answers using kind of private data um you to do that you need that conversation history and you need those kind of prompt engineering techniques or like change fine tune in uh you know there's kind of tree or Forks now I've I've named my own value chain prompting so this is where you put the value chain into the prompt and it helps you know it's actually to be understand the contacts context and it helps you with your we you know become a map and open development strategies so if you look at the kind of flowing down from the techniques you've got guardrails so everybody should be looking at guard rails making sure that their their service at the building you know using large models it you know meets kind of ethical uh your ethical conditions the ones that you decide to use um you've got the chains so we talk about chains they need that kind of Agents and agents allow you to um do multiple things query multiple llms query tools so you can go out to external data go to the web um query other services called apis get data back put that into your into your LMN model you know create with kind of chat GDP Etc and you can also build custom agents and you probably have to do that if you're using depending on your data your private data and also the agents can access private data and to support private data you need to kind of metadata about the data and then I've got the bottom of the map there we've got pets which is the Privacy enhancing Technologies or techniques and also you you know you need um you should be thinking about data Ops in ml Ops and also thin Ops within your uh Services because you need to understand the costs and the cost models for your large language models you know especially around the kind of tokens and we've just seen you know open AI reduce the cost of theirs and you can also see those kind of red lines so we know that agents are kind of in the kind of product space and they're going to move into that commodity space over time and prompt templates I mean I guess they're already a commodity now there's there's thousands of them out there on the internet so kind of moving down the stack uh yeah we've got pets we've got embedding so if you want to work with private you know your own private data you need you need a vector of vectors need embeddings so um there's various different ways of doing embeddings you know from up in AI to you know cohere and and Fast Tax and something I put on the left-hand side of the map is using uh encrypted embeddings um so to protect your private layer um to do primary enhancing Technologies there's two called Folly homorphic encryption multi-party computation follow morphing Christian a multi-party party computation allow you to encrypt your data and still do analysis on that data while it's still encrypted so a key element if you want to protect your data when you're using llms uh you've got the concrete LM ml there they they have great encrypted machine learning models that you can still uh query when they're still encrypted and that's uh from Clinical Zama and you've got Cape privacy that are looking at um pets for uh chats so they've got a uh chat bot that protects and encrypts your data in the chat um uh Tool uh web web interface so you're doing your embeddings to do embeddings you need like a chunking and chunks to do that you need a tech splitter there's various different text abilities based on different types of text you know from PDS to plain text to you know YouTube videos scripts you know there's there's quite a few um uh lamma Hub and uh you know Lang chain they both have offer many different text bidders um and then you kind of go down you need a vector database the story of vectors so you've got options like super bass chroma uh you know pine cone and I'm sure all of them are doing different talks today at some point over the next couple of days and pretty much as we go down the stack you'll probably find at some point you know over the next couple of days you'll find some of them talking about stuff and then you know your vector database you need those kind of search algorithms so you know like the nearest neighbors and you know the Facebook one face um moving down further you know your your vector ogles and your vector database you know that needs a you know kind of cloud to operate and then you actually get eventually get down to the kind of Lawrence language models so we've got open AI but you also got you know Dolly alpaca llama uh there's new ones like Orca and you've got the Falcon one from the UAE and they're you know they're all they both all claim to be you know excellent and at least as good as chat GDP you've also got the meta massively uh multilingual speech from meta so that works with 100 and 1100 languages and they claim it's you know it's as good as anything that's out there and also on the map we've got this kind of black line that's the llms and that's uh that represents inertia so inertia can be um and a decelerator to you know if it was moving to the right of the map and open source and accelerator so this is why we see open source llams because it accelerates those those Services moving over to uh Commodities and we kind of got open AI now what we can do if we look at the large map we can say like you know people talk about prompt engineering it's not prompt engineering it's prompt crafting it's literally just writing prompts yeah then we've got the Big Stone Department about our all goes you know nearest neighbor that's computer science we've got the stuff around the large language models that's data science then we've got the stuff all the kind of infrastructure all that that's ml Ops then we've got actually got prompt engineer which is all the stuff at the top and it's much bigger than it is literally engineering not uh writing scripts this is what openai does this is oh sorry this is what open AR does in the public this is what opening capabilities open AI have if they decide at any point to make any of this available for other apis apis they're going to eat your services you're currently thinking about building for lunch yeah dinner supper and breakfast because they have a platform at any moment they can turn API apis onto any part of their infrastructure and then they they will just basically whatever you're thinking about building uh that's kind of my just getting the 10 minutes so what we can do with body Maps we can understand user needs build that value chain understand the evolution of those components help with strategic decision making anticipate change understand where to invest understand the technique with that decide where to build a buy there's all the resources and thank you very much I'm done I'll share I'll share the links later awesome thank you yeah and we're also going to get this recorded and share that out as well so thank you so much for joining us Mark we really appreciate it all right okay then all right thank you very much everyone bye [Music]
