hello everyone my name is Ashley gallis I am the founder of art AI um above is my Twitter I'm pretty responsive on there so if you have any questions uh please give me um so I'm going to talk about a genetic relationship management um Hearth is still pretty stealthy but here's our website with our wait list um if you're interested okay so I know this is a lightning talk I'm going to try to move pretty quickly um and it was also meant to set a timer to make sure I was doing that I'm going to talk about who Am I who I'm assuming you are what is heart what do we mean by agentic what do we mean by a genetic relationship management and a case study that talks about a specific user flow we think about at heart our system um some production benchmarks we think through the mission of Hearth and then finally careers because we're hiring okay so who am I um here's my personal website at Ash dot um AI which is cool I got the AI domain a while ago um so I'm actually based here in New York City I've lived here in New York in Palo Alto San Francisco in Berlin in Edinburgh I've been working in the machine learning space for about a decade now um did some early internships at Facebook I worked for NASA um I worked at ml Airbnb and apple uh I spent two years building and racing a solar powered car which was pretty cool I went to Australia to race it and was there for a while and then um I spent two years working in American politics as a machine learning engineer in 2020 um and then went to Eric Schmidt's philanthropy after and um have now started Hearth about a year ago so my main mission is really to build AI that augments The Human Experience um so this talk kind of assumes that you all are Builders and are currently working in Ai and you're looking to learn more about our technical approaches to agentic products okay so what is Hearth um kind of the problem we think about is that today our personal and professional networks have reach an unprecedented level of complexity like even for this chat I would love to have all of you automatically added to my LinkedIn and to Twitter and to kind of systematize keeping in touch because you all are interested in AI um as I am but that would actually be really hard to do um so you know even today despite being glued to our screens we're still dropping relevant communication threads wasting time on manual data entry tasks so a lot of us have like spreadsheets or notion databases we're tracking people on we're losing key Network details we're failing to match the right people with the right opportunities at the right time and we're letting our important relationships grow cold so the solution that we think about is a genetic relationship management and this is a suite of products that leverage AI agents to learn from understand and act on behalf of the user so Hearth AI will synthesize and manage your network complexity so that you can focus on connection so what do we actually mean by agenda these are AI systems that leverage large language models that would be the simulated world over here and human feedback to determine which actions to take and in which order kind of the key here is that these products are executing a series of observations thoughts and actions to mean an objective and we'll kind of talk through how we're thinking about that in a few slides so what do we mean by authentic relationship category uh management um so we kind of see this as a new category in this world agents are AI systems that are personalized to a Persona Think Like A salesperson Partnerships BD capital allocator a specific team or an individual through communication and social network Integrations and their objective is to maximize different network workflows so what do I mean by Network workflows um the world of what this could look like is pretty vast some examples include you know which of my relationships are growing cold you know I'm in a new city I'm traveling to Austin Seattle who should I meet with who are the people in the sales meeting that I'm about to go on um what is my network news today so if I'm a capital allocator and my portfolio company hires a new candidate you know I should know that and then congratulate my team um so Auto ad conference attendees to my socials that would be really relevant here and then who does my teammate know that I should actually know okay so we'll narrow this to kind of one case study and that is this user flow for keeping relationships warm so here her sends me a daily briefing essentially saying you know here's Jody you're about to go on an investor intro call here's her LinkedIn her Twitter here's kind of the summary of what we have on her and here's some mutuals and then interestingly I might tell her hey keep my relationship with Jody warm and then Hearth lets me know if there are no Communications exchanged um on Mark May 10th uh hartho ping me and I'll remember to like reach out to Jody and that's kind of an example of like this authentic structure within the user flow is one case study um so what does this actually mean for our agent um here's where we kind of Step through levels of like thoughts actions and observations so we start with the user query of like keep this relationship with Jody warm the agent thinks you know I need to keep this relationship with Jody warm and then we'll move to an action model to see if this fits into a hearth action workflow or if it should be kicked somewhere else so it does look like it's a hard action workload something we support so the next level is who is Jody like who is that in the knowledge base and that would then be a search on Jody and kind of the context which in this case is the briefing or the nudge and then from the previous context we identify like Jody's full name and then that third level is you know I need to determine when this relationship is is cold and kind of warn the user so from there Hearth would have a relationship model where it's basically coming up with an amount of time that might pass before this relationship is called and you can imagine like starting pretty naive with you know maybe people are important to me that I've spent a lot of time with and then growing in complexity to what we mean by like an underlying preference model um and then finally there's a reminder system or workflow where if there's no communication heart will then send me a slack message and uh let me know to reach out so kind of visually what does this mean it means that users really only see the slack Dynamic but behind the scenes there's this Hearth agent which is then taking the query and putting it in a query model which it then determines you know is this search through a document store is it an action that we support or is it feedback um around like a previous interaction that's telling me I did a good or bad job and so if it is an action model from there like we discussed we would then kick it to a relationship model determine the amount of time that should be passed and then have a reminder workflow that's running and if it's not we have search which can then query hearth's enriched contact system that's refreshing okay so there is a lot to test in production and I think a lot of us are all working through this at the same time and that means our team really focuses on kind of a benchmark and test Suite that captures a lot of this so prompts um this needs pretty rigorous a vowel setup it's kind of wild to see what seems like minor changes and prompts really changing the output embeddings Vector Stores um I would urge everyone to like watch out for sneaky costs which is something our team has had to work through this week and the whole landscape of vector stores is changing really quickly especially when we talk about like production level data augmenting so again even simple things have had a big effect for us like indicating chronological order for meetings um as a feature um results in like better outputs or more sensical outputs from our model an agent's ability to self-refine and search action feedback loop is really important and how this persists in memory um so I know baby AGI has made a lot of like news this week and it's really cool when we think about like what is a long-term feedback loop look like where the model is retaining the user's preferences over like weeks is really interesting um and then a vowels on staff and Ella Labs so go ahead kind of going back to our visual this is actually a suite of many different models and we want to make sure benchmarking covers like their interactions the key Insight here is like the agendic dev ecosystem is very new and the longer term actually calls for agent monitoring systems in the wild as this action layer grows so right now the action is pretty benign it's a reminder system in the future when it's integrated with other platforms or socials we want you know a lot more monitoring and ability to kind of call things back or have a human in the loop so especially if it's like Auto ad focus on Twitter that's something we want more sophistication around and then I wanted to plug John May's work who I think is amazing and he's thinking a lot about these like monitoring systems in the wild as they pertain to the legal space which I think is fascinating okay so just to kind of take a step back the mission of Hearth is to build a new category of a genetic relationship management products that do uh four things that centralize that enrich on your contacts that recommend and that act on your network um so you and your team can focus on connecting um and finally we're hiring for an ml Chief scientist and another ml function here in New York city so come work with us and please reach out if you have any questions okay thank you everyone okay I see a question from the chat how are llms helping you manage the risk of this self-spamming like Google email self reminders um the answer is even before we have that llm wire we have like a pretty thorough processing um even when we think about meetings we're focused on meetings with other attendees in them so we actually haven't gotten to like an llm processing out emails level yet we've been able because we're focused on outbound Network to I think minimize that risk so far with our private data [Music] I think it's a super interesting space that I think um so many of our products will be like stacked lolabs determining other agendic workflows in the future [Music]
