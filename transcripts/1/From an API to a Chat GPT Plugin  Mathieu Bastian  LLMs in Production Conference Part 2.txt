all right so we are in a very intense lightning round right now so next up is Matthew Bastian from get your guide he's going to talk to us about from apis to chat gpg plugin um let's get him on the screen and give him his full 10 minutes hi everyone happy Friday um thanks a lot for the introduction so 10 minutes to talk about uh chat GPD plugin so let's Dive Right In so why actually we were excited about uh plugins at the first place so get your guide if you don't know it is an online Marketplace for travel activities and typically Travelers they they use our app to discover what they can do when they travel here's with Barcelona beautiful and sunny right now um and yeah travel planning is is hard there's so much things you can do in a destination so little time you want to build those incredible memories right and then you're most likely doing that last minute on the go in the Wi-Fi of the hotel booking something to for for today or tomorrow so that's kind of what gets you guys is all about uh helping you discover those incredible activities and experiences you can do in a destination and it turns out that chat GPT is pretty good at travel planning you can give it your instructions um you know give a little bit of a of of preferences what you want to do how long is your itinerary and so on and what we were what we wanted to do is basically enhance this with uh relevant and bookable activities from from get your guide and that's basically where the charge GPT plugin comes in and all you need is uh is actually an API the the whole architecture is built around these manifest file so very simply we have a single endpoint to retrieve activities you describe what it is in in pure language you add some description about parameters kind of like date filters or Price filter or whatever um also responses uh and and schemas and so on so that's basically all you have to do and the chat GPT plugin infrastructure would convert these prompts into API calls that retrieve the results and it's a bit of a of an art right so you need to be uh you know maybe hiding some parameters and doing a bit of of massaging of the description to get rid of the behavior you're looking for but it's it's really simple and um that's what we did uh we shipped that um you know pretty quickly was actually a very moderate effort uh team effort and you know just with a within a week with a few Engineers were able to get our plugin uh released it's not really that you know I'm bragging or anything it's more that the architecture the is very elegant you don't really have to do much code and of course you have to have an API in the first place but that's probably not so uh uncommon and and here you go you have a a workable uh plugin of chat gbt uh that's what it looks like essentially you're prompted with uh with your intent and you will get some activities you can do here in Paris and it even has this last nice little Snippets that you can click on and continue your your journey um on get your guide and basically with with what it does in the prompt is really identify um these entities like locations but also dates you know next Saturday tomorrow on Christmas it's able to convert all of that then some kind of Interest so you can say I like outdoor um you know I'm interested in food or and so on and so forth and then maybe some other types of filters that we support such as I'm traveling solo or I have a budget and so on and so forth so all of these uh kind of elements in the prompts would be converted into some kind of API parameters that we can we can understand [Music] um a couple of learnings from building this um first of all testing was a bit of a challenge uh it's of course early days but it's really early days sometimes uh you can only have up to 15 users uh testing the plugin when it's in development and releasing is a bit of a pain as well if you change something in the Manifest your plugin gets disapproved and it may take actually a couple of days until it's approved again so that's uh you know kind of not the same experience as the the Apple Store uh but still it's early days um the API design was uh was a good learning for us you kind of need to really be specific you know about date formats or making your errors very understandable so that the bot can actually play with this uh nicely and and get you get the behavior that you want and we we discovered many interesting Concepts through this um build out for example prompt injection something to think about and also this open graph protocol that is a bit behind this uh little image Snippets that you saw in the in the screenshot a few other learnings from our side is that it's it makes us rethink how how the API should be built for these types of applications because context is hard you're going to be pretty specific about what you want uh you know I like croissant for example or like you're going to be more um more verbose about your preferences and typically our API or service are more like working with implicit personalization such as okay you booked a couple of adventure activities or you're more into food and then we're gonna show you more of this uh these types of experiences but here you can really go deep in in telling GPT what you want and then we don't fully understand all of that yet what's really challenging at this point is how to improve the bot because we actually have no data or insights about kind of what what are the prompts that uh that are you know originating to the queries we receive so that's uh that's something we we hope uh will improve and then we were blown away by the ability for uh the infrastructure to translate requests and responses so we kind of build once and you get an application usable in basically all possible languages which is amazing so I hope I got you inspired by uh by this uh Journey we actually got inspired uh a lot also to continue and we thought that maybe we should try to build our own chatbot um and essentially could we have the same functionality but integrated into our website or into our app and the way we thought about this was could we reverse engineer the way chat GPT translates these prompts into into API calls so that was a little bit of a tinkering and you know what if can we do this and it turns out that it works and you end up with a very simple architecture that you receive a prompt uh what can I do in Miami for example uh to our get your guide chat we send that to chat GPT to translate that query into the same API specifications um that um you know we would receive from the chat GPT plugin infrastructure then we execute that query to retrieve in that case or experiences and then send that response back to the user and that's um you know essentially the magic behind it we I'm showing you you here the the system prompt that actually replicates the chat GPT plugin capability so with that system prompt and the user prompt judge GPT is able to get us the API specs that we need to call you know with the right filters uh and the right parameters then we execute that and then we send it back to the user so it was fun to uh to play with this of course uh this now is obsolete right uh as everything with llms uh within a couple of days there's this very cool uh function calling uh rollout from open a open AI that I think pretty much does this without having to to do this system prompt and that's probably something we need to take a look at and uh and uh and build further so yeah that uh that was a little journey uh building chat GPT plugin I hope uh you enjoyed it and I'm open for maybe one or two questions awesome thank you so much we are gonna have to send you send you some much Matthew sorry it's been a long day um we really appreciate it this is awesome thank you bye bye thank you bye [Music]
