[Music] hey hey how doing hello yeah good to see you okay we can hear you okay and we can also see behind the scenes the challenges on building AI applications well first off thank for inviting me to the to the talk and I really appreciate the opportunity to be here uh I'm usy currently working as fing product manager Elon AI where we help uh user and clients ship their rest learning work so much easier so the topic today I'm bringing over it uh behind the scenes the Trav on M applications where I will be sharing my personal experience I'm buing a general a a applications in the financial Industries uh we do have like briefly short agenda for today starting with the earnings age it's a it's a a it's more like a u It's actually an idea I came up with when I was working in Singapore with my roommate who's working in government sex um in terms of like investment settling stuff like that and after that I'll be I'll be unveiling some challenges that rest throughout the whole process how I resolve them and field takeaways okay so the first thing learning stage so imagine like imagine like if you're working in a going tax on the M section or like fund management you'll be like managing tens tons of billions of monies on on your daily basis and one of your daily routines is actually like paying attention to those earning costs coming out of uh coming out of either that Tech or a lot of other stock exchanges so um one tricky question for people working in different time Zs is like for example if you're like a fund management a portfolio manager for fund management working in Singapore and you're managing fun in US you have to be like waking up in the mid in the middle of night listening to the whole earning report and asking questions alongside without what imagine how hard that could be if you're like working you Pro probably need to be working for like Le Le like five days or like TW about like 20 days per months and that could be like breaking your schedule all the time so imagine if there could be an assistant where it could be acting as a shadow CFO for the for for portfolio companies to answer the questions as an investor and that could be helping a lot a lot on both side of the companies and the investors so that's like what it is so a brief not show on what it on what it looks like is like this is like the side by-side comparison between ch v0.5 and a over fun model which is earning stage so under the exact same instruction in counton the fun model on the right side which is more detailed and past more like CFO as you can see it actually can actually could be like catching the tones of like when a CFO talks about its own products and in terms of like Speed and Performance it's like 60% faster in this case um feel free to try out this demo in earning say Runing still and running so the how how do how do we do it how do I do it uh the the INF for under is actually quite straightforward it's it's quite traditional if you think about like because like nowadays everybody's talking about like how you could be curing documentations based on pre-existing files so there would be indexing stage referal stage and generation stage right for the indexing stage you basically um input all the earning P transcripts Chun them up into into do into document chunks put them into Factor databases put the retrieval state will be combining the instruction the instruction will be like you are a financial assistant um you do not answer the question outside of financial questions and the context which is related to the related to related to the user query so we do a bit of like dist calculation over there and well it's it's it's quite it's I would say it's like it's a bit of like force I think I could I think we would do it better but like it was like for Dem purpose back then so that that got like compressed into the whole prompt and set over to the generation stage which the tax generation models known as LS will be given based on the input so that's a simplified for nut show The Challenge under this part the first challenge in within that whole process the first the biggest challenge is like the listing data even like if you're recalling back to OD earning cost like for for example um a standard a standard company in NASDAQ they have like about four earning cost per fiscal year and adding that up that's still not enough data for like if you want to be training uh if you want to be training a model it's like quite fit into the industry so one thing I did is to like lab gbd4 by applying synthetic data generation with with like comp with data ETL from earning C transcript convert that into conversation on Json with some with some PR to extract the Key Properties based on the input and that essenti I got my in Rich data set so that's the first challenge the missing data and the key to the key the way we resolve it is to apply is to apply synthetic dat generation and the Second Challenge it's expensive XM like um like if you if you think about like uh on on the open pricing page if you're if you're using CH .5 for uh either for like pretty standard price it's about like 004 .3% token and each crash could be easy to go about like 1, tokens based on the based on the context so in this case we to find like smaller models works even much way much better than chvt due to the narrow scope because like the question is so scope so narrow you don't need you don't we do not need a huge or a large F model to do it a fine 27b model could be way much better than than we saw so in terms of Interest time it's 60% faster in terms of the cost it's 16 Subs cheaper and for Quality wise it's at least 50% better so that's a second part on how we resolve the cost of LM and here comes the third part is more than just LM because like if you actually if we're like actually be an application out of laor it's more than just it's like if when we are when you are like shipping this application to the end users the analyst would like to see something that's like more fit into their needs which means want something real time and and the uh the number being predicted by models need to be able to get um get amount of get amount good amount of like reference on where that that that does that number come from so it's going to be actually leveraging both l and a lot of other models including models such as like ASR models whisper X conventional prediction models including lstf Etc and some rization models for finance specifically in the financial industry so that's a that's a thir challenge it's more than simply just and what we did uh back at uh uh what we did at at at lepton AI is we actually made a made an open source tool where which it helps you to like prototype your a applications by converting any hugging based models into a services within one line of code um basically you do let F run of the and passing through the the string of the hugging face model and you can trade a machine learning service out of it and you will be able to consume it right away instead of instead of having a dedicated that box do it so that'll be that that's like the three biggest challenges I encountered through the whole process and here a few takeaways the first is like finding a good scope of the problem matters way much more than simply using any models the more narrow scape the better performance in terms of SP quality and speed the second part is like work smart with open Ai and chbt for example leveraging leveraging the synthetic data generation techniques and the third part on working with om is to ask for format but not content leave the content blank for like conventional models because like especially in the finance industry you need to be asking for the reference and and inability of the models so these are the brief um introduction and um and my walkthroughs and takeaways on my experience on building this financial application and um that be it thank you very much and right on time too can you scroll to just the last slide just that say conventional models you do you mean like non Z learning ones kind of like yeah exactly so like yeah exactly in terms of like a financial industry if you want to be predicting the pricing of the stocks which is used all the time in the uh in the high frequency trading you'll be using more of well well I guess it depend like you could be using RN or reinforcement based learning rather than transformative models or or for like F management they'll be more likely to use like OS team or linear models yeah yeah because they because they need they need to have the inability of the model to explain to their investors to their LPS like why we're putting money into into this company into this portfolio company or into this industry specifically yeah yeah and I imagine that like depending on the branch within Finance I think like in some of banking it also gets quite highly regulated so the inability is like a is mandatory there uh thank you very much thank you for coming and for sharing your insights with [Music] us
