[Music] [Music] Lily is up next and Lily is one of these talks that I've heard from like three or four people about Lily I just got to say it four different people mentioned your name to me and it was like you got to have her come to the conference and give a talk so I'm very excited for this talk but I don't get the same intro as Harrison I'll never feel the same way you want it we can run it again and I could just say your name okay I'm Okay I lied let's go let's go you're like it we're already over time it's all good don't worry about it no I mean no you don't get that kind of intro I maybe next year I I don't know what to tell you that's all I can say you're right I have to come back multiple years in order to like earn the right I understand exactly exactly so uh I'm excited for your talk I'm gonna kick it over to you and then I'll be back in 10 minutes okay see you then yeah all right welcome to my talk called llm Valley it is a video game theme talk about the generative AI product Market specifically for venture capital I get this question time and time again people want to know what's Venture funding uh what are they looking for when they they write you that $5 million check or bigger whatever so I just want to give you guys a little bit of insight into that and so throughout this allegory Journey we're going to meet some different players in the space walk through a couple examples and we're going to come back in like 10 minutes so this is going to go fast so first off basically everybody wants to know what your business model is this is like the first thing they're going to ask you uh the most the four most common ones are B2B s uh B Toc which is business to Consumer open source and foundation so really highle overview B2B SAS is like literally every y combinator company so if if you're a y com if you're in y combinator you're probably B to be it's when businesses sell to other businesses um they get Enterprise contracts Sal Cycles are longer people like that because you can technically make more money we'll see you know that's that's a technically B Toc is you can think of any type of sort of single thing that you sell to an individual so it could be like I'm going to turn a regular photo into a professional head shot you pay like $10 and then you know they have some AI thing that does it for you it's a pretty much a one-off it might be a premium model it could be specific like that where like the use case is literally photo to like professional photo but that's an example of something that's b toy open source uh there's a couple of different ones I think we just heard heard from Lang chain actually so that's a really great example of uh an open- Source business that started off as like hey this is a GitHub repo and then excelled in popularity managed to raise a pretty large Venture round if I can recall correctly uh and is now you know sky the limit and then of course the foundation models everyone knows these this is open AI mid Journey anthropic coh here these are the I'm partnering with Microsoft AWS the the very big players of the world so first off B2B SAS main challenge for these companies if you're a startup right now in B2B SAS is that all of the incumbents are trying to add AI into their product somewhere that doesn't mean you can't win you totally can I do want to talk about an example uh in healthcare where epic EHR is sort of up against a or let's say the startup notable health is actually up against epic EHR so notable health is trying to reimagine basically the way that AI is going to interface with our healthare system epic EHR you've probably used it if you go to the doctors in America you have probably been added to it it's called My Chart is actually the name of the platform it's how you make appointments with your doctors how you might get refills it's how you chat with your doctors your providers all the notes are sort of taken care of in that realm so notable Health has you know a pretty good hypothesis that that type of interface it's not the most efficient uh if you're on the older side maybe you're you know you have difficult navigating it whatever there's a lot of reasons why AI can make it better to to interface with the healthcare system so that's the challenge the problem is that epic EHR is the largest largest Health Care largest Health like Health Software System I think in the United States they they basically like have a monopoly on uh on like hospital ehrs it's pretty difficult to compete with them and I think they have a partnership with Microsoft so it's a little bit of a tossup but I will give it to notable health is that they could probably reimagine fundamentally what that experience looks like in a way that epic cannot so epic is obligated to these hospitals right to like these these people who are actively millions of people who are actively using their platform they cannot iterate quickly they cannot just overnight change the UI to imagine what that should look like notable Health can they can do that so you know when we look at these startups their their opportunity to win is definitely really fast iteration speed ground up design on the other hand incumbents usually have way more resources they have Partnerships with these big foundation models so they're probably getting discounts on stuff um it's a tough battle but that's that's B Tob sass in a nutshell for for fundraising okay B Toc what I have seen is that most Venture company uh most Venture capitalists are not willing to fund a true B Toc Play It's just really really hard to get significant traction uh without huge churn that's that's basically the problem that people are running into on the other hand and I this is my disclaimer it has never been easier to spin up an AI B Toc product like like that headshot example I gave I mean you could theoretically build that in a weekend if that's a text deck that you are familiar with where you could you know spin it up in react you're going to use um you know your familiar with an image generator API that you like to use and you got some good prompting like that is something that in the past you could not just do in a weekend but today with the apis that we have available it's totally possible um just my disclaimer is that what I've seen is that most Venture capitals uh will not will not fund this but if you're a bootstrap developer power to you I've seen some stuff on Twitter I have no clue how much I believe it but I've seen people on Twitter claim that they are like making 100K MMR Mr for like these random B Toc ideas like interior design head shots I've seen um a couple of others like in that like very random single use category so you have it okay open source you want to know what open source projects are just go to GitHub go to trending repos I bet the top three are probably AI or llm related and like I said Lang Chang is I think the best example of an open source company uh that you know just started off as a GitHub project and is now very legitimately a company they raised a $10 million feed from Benchmark which is a really great Venture firm uh and I'm sure they're now working on monetization so open source is a great way to see if your idea has any traction like are developers willing to build on it uh if developers are usually that means your technolog is pretty sticky and users will love it so it's not a bad strategy right like you're doing it because theoretically you love it you made a project you you put it out into the world and then you know it's a kind of a lowrisk way too for Venture capitals to be like oh yeah it's got a bajillion stars on GitHub let me write you a bajillion dollar check for all of your stars on GitHub and then last category we have is the foundation models you are probably not starting a new Foundation model company today uh be very doubtful if that were the case um I think you know between open Ai and thropic uh mid journey I the the amount of dollars that have been sunk into the GPU cost to train these models I am very doubtful that any New Foundation model will will make a main play there there are some open source models as well so there's a little bit of an overlap in that situation uh but it's it's pretty hard to imagine that you could pitch a VC a New Foundation model type and get funding for it if you do let me know would love to update the slides okay so with that in mind I just wanted to kind of close off with a quote from Kyle Harrison at contrary Capital uh whenever we talk about fundraising product ideas I really love the way Kyle talks about it because this is actually a quote that's not even about AI it's just about raising venture capital in general in building companies so I'll read it to you there aren't enough startups to justify all that capital but why is that because one there aren't enough people building things that people truly want and two there's only so much attention time energy disposable income corporate spend that people have to give there is a finite amount of taste in the world a lot of brands have Thrive because they are surprisingly big Niche Mark Niche markets like mushroom forging that can sustain a certain amount of value creation and capture but the biggest misallocation of capital is the limited understanding of taste what do people actually want so I just kind of ran through like four different Market strategies for different products that you can build in AI gave you some ideas of what people have been building in AI but at the end of the day what we really have to remember is that you need to build things that people want and the fact that you can now use AI to do it doesn't actually mean anything more you still have to find out what it is that what is that taste because AI is a tool like anything else and it will help you build something that maybe was not possible for people to want before but you still have to find out what that want is so shout out to Kyle um that that quote is from uh his substack so subscribe to his substack and thanks for playing with me on uh my video game themed llm Valley you can find me on some of these socials thank you so much I'm gonna throw it back I allow to throw it back well will you take it oh nice no we're just GNA leave you here to host this thing now it's all you
