next up we're going to keep cruising and we have a very special guest we are talking with Travis who won the ml Ops Community hackathon we had two weeks ago now in San Francisco and so it was all about your llm stack and your team won can you break that down for us what was that whole process yeah absolutely just want to make sure you can hear me see slides everything yeah I can hear you I can't see the slides yet but uh tell us about hackathon and then I'll throw the slides on okay um so we yeah there were two tracks uh this was uh super fun in person just one day 12 hour hackathon uh honestly a format I prefer over um doing like an overnight 24-hour thing and yeah the uh huge shout out to everyone that helped helps run it uh Rahul P especially I was just at ml hops last night with him great guy it provided some groundwork for all the teams um so what we did is we kind of had a multi-prong effort um are there any slides yet oh you're ready you're ready to jump into it no no I'll go all right here we go slides coming slide's coming okay oh I see myself now yeah then we're getting the infinite lost in it all right awesome and dude I will I will mention to everyone too because you may not mention it but you're re-implementing Lang Chang and go right I am yeah we've been a little quiet about it just yet but um we're gonna we're gonna be promoting it a lot and excited about getting more maintainers um we're almost even just leaving you know it's not a full-time thing just a side thing for me just open source contribution and I don't really want to be reviewing hundreds of PRS a day um I don't know if we would get that successful but um but yeah it's going really well it's and it's already it's already fun to see as soon as they dropped Harrison and crew dropped typescript support I was like maybe there's a multi-language uh option here so I've been interviewing him and uh excited about how that project's going to evolve cool all right man I'll get off the stage I'll let you give the 10 minute lightning talk and then uh I'll be back in 10. sounds okay okay so this is the presentation so I'm going to start out um talking about the team involved because I I was just one person I was kind of helping coordinate things and I definitely contributed uh technically but I really want to highlight the entire team here so um I was in some of the networking guts and had some uh existing open source slack work that uh helped us out here um but Zhang Hong was a huge contributor in the the python layer also show you the architecture that we came up with shortly and then forest was very ambitious and he I'm gonna say he pulled it off and that he opted to do it from scratch Point Cloud implementation uh and I'm gonna hopefully give you a brief demo of that uh and then Brenda was super helpful throughout the project and then developed a really fantastic medium post writing it up uh which I'll link to at the end of these slides so what do we do high level we were provided again huge shout out to Rahul uh we were provided ten thousand embeddings of slack conversations from the ml Ops Community slack and we thought how do we make this how do we make this useful so we we tackled it from kind of two directions one was developing a slack bot that tried that you know retrieval-based lockbot that tries to answer questions you know with uh redis vector-based similarity context provided and we also built this embeddings explorer that has some integration into slack which uh I think I'm only sharing my Chrome screen so I there's there'll be a slight Gap in the demo there but I'll uh you'll have to trust me it works I promise um so breaking these down a little bit so we have this go component which does use the link chain go which I'll hype up a bit later on um and we we were redis was a sponsor and it's a really fantastic tool I use it in almost all my projects and we used red is Pub sub as as like at a RPC layer between our python backend that was making open AI calls and the go server was there handling all the slack communication so watching for new content and then you know ultimately responding to questions that it received um the python layer a lot of you are going to be familiar with better and it's not super novel uh retrieval augmented llm lookup so basically given an incoming question grab the couple nearest Neighbors from Vector cosine distance similarity and then Supply those to to gpd4 as context um here are a couple examples of me pretending to be a robot I use my personal credentials we didn't have the I don't know if it would have been appropriate to get an official slackbot in for a hackathon so just use my credentials so that's me speaking as gpt4 and showing that we have a have some of that context provided um you know obviously if we were to take this further that should be a link over to the relevant slot conversation and then here's the topic embeddings Explorer so this is an interact again huge out of the forest an interactive browser visualizer that allows exploring of all that that high dimensionality betting embedding space compressed down into three dimensions this is using a technique called umap uh and a huge shout out to the folks at arise um aparna and Xander in particular I didn't even know this was a thing until like she's probably three or four weeks ago uh back in those two weeks ago now and um it's really incredible to see and I'm gonna try to pop out can you see my can you see the points I don't have the so this is a visualization of all the slack threads um I upgraded a newer Mac OS and it is my video performance is struggling a little bit um but I promise it should run smoothly for you and so this shows slack conversations here and we have a little ability to jump right to the thread in question so this jumped over to my slack window but I'm only sharing Chrome so you have to trust that popped over just a slack so that lets you go from the 3D visualization and Explorer to jump right jumping right to the the thread in question which is a nice way to kind of tie that all together so this the hackathon was about llm stack and so a fun thing that we use I have I've developed a hackathon template toolkit that's tilt based and we use this to really get off the ground running it was a 12 hour hackathon we had to move fast and here's here's all the components that were visualized uh plus a postgres database um running in in a tilt-based development workflow this allowed us to all start just writing the things we were best at as soon as possible so really really click on it there and I want to talk about now where we want to take this so we won the hackathon there was a small cash prize we were handed again shout out Rahul we were handled handed these 10 000 embeddings we want to continue generating embeddings over new slack thread content and presuming we have permission from uh owners moderators of the space we want to provide that set of embeddings to the community so people don't have to re-pay open AI for all those 802 numbers um other places we wanted to take it haven't yet is to get this the ingestion pipeline real time all the way to the browser so new thread showing up as a new Point cloud in as little time as we can do it um should be able to do it with very little overhead beyond the you know the open Ai call is going to be the slowest part should be the slowest part another thing we're thinking about is showing the evolution of Trends in that point Cloud over time so I don't know it's a slider or an animation but if we render that that 3D Point Cloud we can show conversations emerging themes emerging Technologies emerging that are being talked about in the middle in the mlx Ops Community slack and really see how things are evolving over time and maybe even have some sense about where uh new ideas have have legs um I want to do a deeper integration with link chain goes is actually originally using Lane Chango but we wanted to play to the team's strengths and so we had the python layer that was conducting the open AI calls and with that that is a brief overview of together for the ml mlaps llm stack pack it's wordful um Brenda has a really fantastic write-up there uh and then watch this space this TMC mlaps Community I'm putting everything there so it's really easy to run all of this yourself and uh would really love additional contributors and would love to get those embeddings just available for everyone in the community yes I I love that visual man that is so cool and yeah it's really cool that you've been able to actually take advantage of the data we have so much data in the community and I've always dreamed of doing things with it and so I love the fact that we were able to make that happen it's really awesome yeah yeah we'll probably be doing more and we'll probably do some virtually so if there are people that did not get to attend the San Francisco hackathon we'll probably do it in uh in the virtual space so that wherever you are you can do some cool stuff with it anyway man I will hopefully see you I mean you just heard I'll be in San Francisco in two weeks and we're gonna do this uh llm Avalanche party and so maybe you can present that there or you can do something about it that would be really cool too I'll uh I'll talk to you later we'll be in touch that's great thank you thank you [Music]
