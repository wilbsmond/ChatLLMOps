I am very stoked for your talk uh I've been looking for time series for a long time and to see how generative models can help us spread much more love we need to give much more love to time series models and so I'm very excited to see you doing this the floor is yours so hello I I I must I'm CTO and co-founder on nlet and I will be speaking about time Equity so basically we do 10 series forecasting research and and deployment and we understand that uncertainty is an inic aspect of of reality and time serious research in particular is the systematic approach to unveil the the future so basically H you can think about H sales and you want to to predict those sales in order for for you to take more um informed decision and make some optimization in in your in your pipeline and also H you can have for example H closing values of the Down Jones and and and you want to predict the behavior of those closing bodies and we also understand that time series are the DNA of Finance Commerce energy and Technology at the end of the day companies don't speak in in um in figures they they speak in in in title Series right and at nix we created H the best time series open source cor system in the world we have several python libraries from statistical models to to deep learning models and those libraries are been used a in a lot of companies around the world for example solando wafare Walmart St nextly and we learn a lot from the open source ecosystem and one one particular Insight stood out and it was that forecasting is is extremely hard confusing and expensive because if you want to deploy a forecasting pipeline you have to hire dedicated team of machine learning Engineers machine learning um forecasters so um it would be great if if if there was a generative AI disruption in there so we introduced a tpt1 which is the first generative AI for for temporal data the First Foundation model for time series and there is an important distinction 10 GPT is not a an Ln because we didn't train time GPT using language data we we we used time series data we used more than one 100 billion of Time series data points to train to train tit so it is a large time model instead of large language model and the architecture of the of time DBT we basically pre-trained a a Transformer um uh using our own architecture of a of a of a deep learning deep learning model we used a lot of different data sets from Finance electricity web traffic among among others and we that we we had consistent accurate predictions in fact we did a lot of benchmarks considering different frequencies of the data monthly weekly daily hourly and we compvert time GPT against other models for example the classical statistical ones Theta ETS says Adida IMA Crystal classic but also machine learning models such as leg GBM and even we compared time GPT against h deep learning models for example lstm D TFT and and land hits and we can see that for the majority of the frequencies time GPT outperforms those H those models and it is important to say that this was the performance of zero shot imprint so we we didn't ER train time GPT in the test set that we are evaluating on so TP gpt's orders of magnitude Foster and also is funable in your Enterprise data and you can get even more accurate uh forecast using the finding capabilities of time GPT and you don't need to be a machine learning expert to to use time GPT and it's it is simple H so I will be coding in the next part of the of the of the talk a live demo on how you can use 10 up using the python the python SDK so in this case I will be coding using using beam but you can use any editor that you that you want um you can use time GPT through our nxs python SDK but of course time DPT it is exposed as an API so if you want to make a API request using another programming language you can do that and the code I will be writing today will be available at that uh URL and so let's start coding so imagine that you have electricity demand data and of course you want to to predict the future demands in order for you to optimize H the process and this is really important because you need to know how how much electricity you will be H demanded in order for you to produce that that that electricity so the first thing I'm going to do is just import the necessary libraries and authenticate to the to the python escap so let me do that so here I imported time GPT so let me let me authenticate I already um exposed the environment variable tgpt token and I will be loading the historical data of security month and then I will be floating in the series yes to stum and let's run this this code let's see if it if it works so basically in this in this in this moment I'm just H downloading the the data and and uh plotting them and ER after that I will be showing how you can produce forecast using tgpt so basically we can see that we have four different markets of four different regions in the world and we need to to produce forecast for all H those so H before 10 DP you need to you have to do a lot of things you have to you have to do a hyper paret selection H model selection you have to do this this code in parallel so it requires a lot of a lot of effort and but yeah thanks to TPC you can do that you can create forecast using just one method and of the 10 GPT class so let me let me forecast the historic data frame in this case I will be producing 48 steps ahead of of forecast which corresponds to the to two days and then I will be loading and and the forecast so hopefully this will U run on time so basically here we are calling our API and we are calling the forecast 10 point and yeah we are producing the forecast and just like that you can have forecast which as you can see they are really good because the forecast captures the trend and and the seasonalities of the of the data and yeah that's how how how time DT works and also you can use you can add for example um anomaly detection and just adding a couple of of of new parameters and yeah you can also detect anomalies using using tgpt and this is really important because you want to know the specific dates of of anomalous of anomalous dates just to make more important decisions and as you can see TP is able to capture the anomalies really really really and yeah that's that's that's that's a all from from my site thank you thank you very much with anomalies equal true that blew me away I mean this is a game changer yeah absolutely we should find you on slack uh and keep pinging you with with questions I'm sure folks will try to be deploying this I certainly will aul thank you very [Music] much
