[Music] the first lightning talk floor is going to be yours in just a second let's see if we can hear you okay can you hear me yeah hello hey guys hello people will be uh trickling in and we don't have time for Q&A now for these lightning talks but if people want to ask you questions they should find you on the slack uh and I'll make sure to put the name of the the channel it should should just be Community Conference uh so people will find you there and tag you ideally and I'll be coming in in a little bit uh once you guys uh get started and um I think you also have screen to share so let me see if I can pull this up perfect thank you Adam and thank you for help us um without further Ado I would like to say Let's uh let's kick it off um because today we will talk to you about the assess for assess the value and feasibility of llm use cases with a checklist so just want to imag you guys to imagine something imagine starting on a project you gather with a nice group of colleagues you have an amazing assignment from the business you're energized you feel like yes this is something that we can do you're all working or running in this case towards the same goal but then the bottom hits you get stuck you feel like the project is going nowhere it's getting stuck in Quicks send and the agreed goal seems unreachable you're talking a different language and you're you don't make any progress at all it's frustrating and you're it feels like they're wasting your time we know how that feels because we see that happening on our clients a lot my name is AA I'm a data strategist and practice lead gen here within C and looking at the business talking from a business perspective we have to explain to the organization the impact that we want to make with our use cases all the time my name is Ren dimal I'm a principal data scientist and the technical practice leads uh gen at CIA and I often have to explain to our customers what is the technical feasibility of these use cases yeah I do that all the time then um yeah what we want to do with uh uh yeah what we really learned there is that U success is basically for a large part avoiding the bad projects and today our goal is to basic give you a tool a simple tool that lets you connect this business and technology uh type of people uh on what drives the impact and the feasibility of these llm powered use cases so let's start with a basic um yeah tool or canvus that every business person would understand on the screen you see the impact feasibility Matrix and of course looking at this Matrix everybody wants to be in the upper right corner we want to execute use cases that are of high impact and are that are feasible to execute and of course we want to avoid the ones that are that are in the lower left corner we want to eliminate the ones that are low feasibility and have low impact if we pick one of the use cases that is either in one of the yellow blocks it means that we have to build our capabilities or that we have to accept that these are just quick small gains these days we see generative AI as being a really hot topic we see CL customers coming to us asking for a specific gen use case or an llm use case and during all these ideation workshops that we currently host at clients it's all about llms I want an llm and an llm is everywhere but is it really something that is always solving your issues or is it the golden Hammer syndrome is it just the Hot Topic the new best thing that people want to use looking at these current or recent article that we've seen on Reddit they also talk about llm as being in hype is it always the best solution or can be the more good oldfashioned AI or data science also solve the issues that we have to assess the impact of a use case and in this case specifically an llm use case we use these four pillars in our checklist so we look at the customer profile who is the customer or who is the user that will use this solution we look at the job to be done we discuss the Gen solution that the business has in mind and challenge them on the question do you really need an llm or can this be done in a more traditional good old fashioned AI manner in the end we always check on the value drivers we believe that an llm is a good value in case it's better it's faster and it's cheaper compared to another solution that you might find but going back to this Matrix that's just one of the access impacts we have another one that is focusing on feasibility so uh for the visibility drivers I think it's it's safe to say that people in the in the Cor today you know what the feasibility drivers are but what I really want to share with you is again a little checklist uh so that it goes easier to communicate uh these drivers with your business stakeholders that you have something to take long when you have this conversation so let's go through these these things the first one is the level are we doing just the promts retrieval augmented generation or agents and with agents we know uh you're chaining multiple problems together accuracy is not so great so if you compound it it's going down Yan Lon has made some great slides about that he keeps talking about it on Twitter much to my enjoyment uh take this along with you the second one is how you deploying this use case is it bat or on demand there the key driver is latency uh Chip youan gave a nice talk on the last edition of an production conference that she showed how a response can easily take half as a second to two seconds but for business people you want to connect that to that speed matters and they you can use examples like the BBC's website had a 1second Slowdown that's resulted in a 10% drop in viewers Amazon reportedly loses 1% of Revenue every time the website slows down 4 100 milliseconds that makes it tangible is latency an issue well then maybe uh that makes it less feasible as a use case the third one automation human in the loop or fully automated there the keywords are reliability so the performance but also how risk averse are you to make that relatable I always like this example so 90% accuracy is it any good well if we're recommending movies on Netflix maybe it's okay we can go fully automated but if we're asking answering patient questions I probably want to stay you in the loop over there next one the user is it internal or external there the key word is responsibility and I like responsibility because you can split it up in response and ability and it's a lot easier to respond to your internal users they can more easily reach you but also so for you to reach them it's a lot easier so it's easier to start with internal users then the task is it a specific task or an open-ended task everybody wants to turn whatever they did now into a chat application that's quite hard if you already have an existing UI existing success metrics and you know what you want to get out of it the use case becomes a lot simpler the example that I like the most about that is actually from Philip Carter from honeycom he was on em Community podcast is now also on this conference and he showed out their product they used to have this or they still have this complex query uh tool and they knew that if people use it then they're likely going to stay with their product but now they changed it to also have a natural language career assistant and they uh saw that usage really went up they didn't have to invent a new UI they knew what they were looking for in terms of success and they could also really validate the output of the llm because you could see hey is this a very valid query yes or no go see stop later today um then next uh yeah the final two it's the model so vendor a via API open source or tune models it's a lot easier to get started with the standard model but I actually see quite some business users telling me like oh should we now be training our own models and I think it's nice to be able to explain them well let's start with an off-the-shelf model and then we'll see if we need to tune it and then finally the data uh I like to distinguish between let's say public data company level sensitive data and individual level sensitive data you always of course need to check the terms and conditions for this data uh but I could check with uh people when they talk about tuning or retrieval orent generation is okay then we need to think more about yeah what level sensitivity do we have and how does that make our application more complex when we need to delineate who can see what so there you have it these are the seven feasibility checklist items yeah so putting it all together in the beginning of this talk we showed you the feasibility impact Matrix a common business tool that is used uh within the business side of the company quite a lot and we combined it with two checklists one to assess the impact of an llm use case and one to assess the feasibility of an llm use case so I think we could stay that it's not rocket science but you have to do it together to actually show whether the use case that you or your business counterpart has in mind is actually bringing value to the organization because it makes impact and it's it's feasible to execute we can imagine that having a lots of information in the past 10 minutes might be a bit of an overload so if you want to reread the slides again or use the checklist within an assignment that you're working on please download our slides or reach out thank you thank you very much guys and you guys should be on the slack I'm sure people will have questions for you uh these Frameworks sound incredibly useful I can already picture a few startups that I should send this to to assess or reassess whether their Investments are worthwhile thank you very much Eva and [Music] rign
