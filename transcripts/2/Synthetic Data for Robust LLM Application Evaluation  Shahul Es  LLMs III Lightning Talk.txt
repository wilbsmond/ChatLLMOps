[Music] okay how are you I I'm thanks F good man thanks for doing it uh everyone and we'll be talking about synthetic data for valuation so first who am I exporting evaluation FW for generation search engine profession the so let's dive in so synthetic data so in in m and race being consuming expensive and given that theing abilities of from use iing and label data this process can be further uh improved uh in efficiency to produce synthetic data instead ofation also there is an issue of work start problem where Val anything and testing an bike means where the initial where there is initial data to evaluate and the alms can be very effectively used to clear data and then uh use it for the well so the said by said ISU that there is a continuous documents into your pip C EIC and also any expensive so uh let's in and see some of the recent Works in synthetic data so the first one and one of the most impressive papers in this domain it's creates synthetic data uh mean instruction output players set up documents also ensuring a certain am of the and the second one which is also the most recent one is the uh which is the method used by the vuse high p and the big data for tring and training so so they also have an speed mechanism as you can see here which shows High quantity data set with samples so let and see um look about the data based onum so the SC you approach where you have a set of documents and you can you feed those set of documents intoing and answer so this is very simple it's an there are PS which being the next side so uh I will discuss of the challenges of this uh apprach roach here so MLM you tend to follow a common path while generating that a so whether if you and to question and answer from it it is most that it has a questions and answers which will need to very less diverse set of instructure there is also Act of control in the distribution here because the data gener types of questions and answers is Sol based on capability and install cannot Beed by also uring factuality Generations is important because and is need even though the answer is grounded on the given text that can be some uh statements that cannot be valued by the context so instead p in such is also important so here we are working on an from a set of documents so the main to a set of instructions uh from a given uh from a given set of and these set of instructions should also specific data distribution which can be controlled by the user for example if you see um data that can be generated from a setup one the can different type of instructions uh for example there can be instructions which involve a complexing that can be instructions which involve a complex station operation or instruction and that involve multiple complex that reques multiple compx to there is also an issue of uh viting the document so many every minutes child can cannot produce high quality data because the information the qu question is how we dependent on the quality of the do underling document so there is also a need of maintain the or Ure that it can produce a high quality data once that is the question can be generated from the given document which can be further using any set of any type of question into Anye question reasoning conditioning or M this process uh the document and the source document and the compar I need to ensure that the given answer the generator answer for the is down very down in text so we can check out uh the uh the code and for the in so uh uses of test the this can be very effectiv used to G of samples or assets that can be used to for and can be also use where that can be multiple um coming for example in generation F you may add two type of two comp which is and optimizing these you how proper evaluation framework and so and moreover this can be used to to for continuous evaluation continuous evaluation and testing of your application by add think this in your framework and generating person uh to Ure high high qu this uh set of uh synthetic data generation can also renew the developer time aggregating in data by n in evaluation because only P will be send spend on ensuring the generating thata and since the data is already generated by the end um so uh that's it uh folks if you have any questions you can reach out to me or username and being so awesome sh thank you very much uh and people might be able to find you on slack as well I already saw a few questions come in uh through gradual it's crazy to think that just like a couple years ago people were talking about I mean just like labeling and coming up with training data and then evaluation I mean this was like the biggest hurdle right and you had just like massive startups found just to solve this problem I mean it's it's not a surprised that as soon as we got llms on our hands like the first thing we should do is come up with some evaluation uh data to help right test other models and now to start to help test themselves so great to see I will share the link to the SL in the set um yeah and uh prob on point I think in future will be able to and awesome so thank you very much for joining [Music] us
