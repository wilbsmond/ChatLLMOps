to Keynote number two this is exciting because we've got a very special panel coming up and I'm going to invite my friend Paul back onto the stage this is not his first time on the stage awesome talk earlier and now I'm going to hand it over to you for this next panel thank you Demetrius so um for today what we wanted to do um as many of you are out there are are you know Building Products some of you might be building companies um we get the pleasure to talk to many companies out there the founders uh that are building interesting companies in this new space uh we thought to actually bring some of the ones that we've spoken to recently together to discuss this and uh joining me today to moderate this panel before I introduce the actual panelist is sandep joining us from London I think sandip can you hear me yep yeah hey sandip thanks for joining us uh great to see you so uh sandip you had our uh Investments uh team in Europe and also look at the at at North America uh we get the pleasure of working together a lot and uh and talking to interesting Founders out there so thanks for uh for joining us do you want to maybe add something today what's on your mind uh no look extremely proud and privilege to be part of this uh this this amazing session that you've put together and um yeah we work in close con Junction and and wanted to share you know some of the um really exciting companies that we have the the pleasure of speaking with on um on nearly a day-to-day basis and hopefully the audience um enjoys hearing from them so perhaps uh we'll pass it over to the people that the people are here to see excellent so let's do that so we we we asked uh uh three founders to join us uh these are technical Founders uh that uh have basically chosen to found their own companies in the space which is probably one of the most most exciting spaces to be building your company in um and so let me just uh uh introduce them uh one by one so I think I see here Petro dialing in from uh from Canada good morning to you hey good morning Paul good morning everybody great to see you again uh Petro do you want to maybe uh describe what you're building at transitional forms and uh the new type of media you've been uh you know working on uh and also maybe for the folks who are listening tell us a little bit about the stage you're in with the company and and sort of the size yeah for sure so um we started as a creative uh machine intelligence company um back in 2018 my background is in um entertainment Innovation so I came from a a a company that I had sold to uh entertainment one um and so I had this you know foresight that um different AI generators were going to do all these amazing things and unlock human uh imagination for for us and so I started a company called transitional forms a number of years ago and we've we've done a bunch of experimentation in different types of AI to create uh you know creative content um from reinforcement learning to llms to music Transformers and we're about 10 10ish people now on any given day uh wear all different hats all the time and um we've created a TV platform that allows you to generate shows uh but TV shows by a click of a button awesome thanks PTO thanks for the introduction I think you also uh shared a video uh that sort of illustrates some of the work that you guys have been doing so maybe we can play that video to bring uh bring this uh some of the stuff that you're building to live in a visual way attention fellow content creators here's a sneak peek of our new maker app where realtime AI generated TV is just a click away choose from 2D or 3D templates and simply edit your titles and premise prompts or customize further with story Beats Music themes and sound effects and Camera filters you can even swap entire sets in a matter of seconds customize your cast and even change their backstories for more Dynamic results to prove the power of this patent pending Tech we developed a live stream generative variety show called robots make TV robots make TV remember that if it's not broke you must break it someday you'll be an alien but only if someone farts on you in our space you both suck LOL and these outputs are all real time fully autonomous and never the same twice because no reality is to win y so connect with us to bring your story worlds to life great thanks for sharing that be I remember when we spoke for the first time a thought that came to mind was you know is this what Pixar looked like in the early days this sort of new you know way of of of creating entertainment this interactive movie making so uh really great to to to share that maybe then over to uh to Lars who's a CTO and co-founder at cord. Lars thanks for joining us I think from New York if I'm not mistaken uh maybe you want to tell us a little bit about the problem you're solving at cord. and um and also where you are with the company which stage and uh and just to give the folks an idea yeah of course thank you so much for inviting me so my background is actually generative models I've been researching in gener with models and been doing a lot within that field and I've been for many years trying to explain to people why it's so cool and then suddenly Outburst a lot of generative Ai and now it's called gen Ai and everybody knows why it's cool so that's amazing basically what we've tried to emphasize with our company is that um we want to to solve a big pain that is the medical conversation so when someone is having a conversation with a doctor and nurse a paramedic uh they really wanted to want to be understood and that conversation could be difficult to be understood because uh not everyone knows how to actually explain their symptoms in the right way and so forth and if you're misunderstood uh then you can end up in a dire situation uh we started out in the very acute field so the 911 call when someone calls a 911 number in the US or 112 around Mainland Europe uh then they're in D need of help and um to u to get some assistance from the person the paramedic that is receiving that call can be difficult um so we have built this AI that Taps into that medical consultation that medical conversation and assist the healthcare professional in making the right choice uh in in a matter of in a in a matter of seconds so the AI is listening again it's understanding what is being said and then it's giving prompts to the healthcare professional for the healthcare professional to to work work their magic uh for the patient and for the better of the patient we are right now in the company approximately 100 people we just raised our series B where process one of the lead in investors in that round and very happy to join this well great thanks for letting us be part of the journey and uh I remember when when we first spoke uh LS I asked you s of you know what's your background can you send some material you've been working on and you send a couple of Publications also at nurp if I remember and uh you know that's uh that's the kind of Founders I think we we uh we enjoy working with with a deep Tech background and I think uh not only that you're solving an incredibly important problem for for all of us so uh we're rooting for you um and then maybe introdu last introduction Josh thanks for joining us uh I think you're if I'm not mistaken in Philadelphia is that correct am I San Francisco right now San Francisco all right even further away so thanks for joining early in your day um maybe the same question to you Yash so uh what problem are you solving and where are you at the stage of uh of Martian at the moment yeah um we're trying to make uh using LMS more like using electricity right right now there's many different LM providers it's hard to figure out which one should you use most people default to gp4 which is the most expensive one um we want to make it as easy as plugging uh your your application into an llm uh just as you would plug a uh you know electrical socket into an outlet right such that you don't have to worry about where you're getting your intelligence from just that you're getting enough of it as cheaply as possible um we're already able to do this today in fact on open ai's own e valves we're able to beat GPT four level performance at a lower cost by routing your request to the right model right so you give us your request we find the best model to run it on best meaning the highest level of performance at the lowest cost and then we give you the result yeah that that's uh incredible and uh also there you know I remember when I heard about what you guys are doing at Martian and we talked about what we're building inside the group one of the things being plus one the first thing I thought was I want to use what you guys are building we need something like this so uh again uh very excited to uh to have this conversation so maybe sandip I'll let you do the honors of the first question of course of course so look um thanks so much for for sharing the introduction we heard about the Myriad use cases that each one of you are solving through um through through your company so perhaps just to start out Petro um would love to understand you know in the the creative content space who do you believe to be the incumbent in the space if anybody and why do you feel like your best position to uh to to solve this problem um it's one of the one of the common questions that we ask in the in the Venture world so would love to hear your perspective sure so you know there there are um incumbents and and and uh various forms of competition we see uh generative uh creativity emerging all day that seems like every day there's a new tool um you know Runway ML and and mid journey and stable diffusion and all of these amazing tools that we use these tools as well in in our pipeline um but at the same time and this isn't a good thing there's not a lot of people that are taking exactly our approach um um and you know I'm a I'm an old VR Pioneer um so real time interactive immersive possibilities for immersion have been very important to me from the beginning so versus these like um hard ml approaches with with Gans and diffusion models and and whatnot we're going with the real time uh uh approach in in a game engine using Unity so um that's our that's our angle right now and there's not a ton of competition like I said that's not necessarily a good thing you kind of need competition to prove the future of what you're trying to build um but yeah that I I think that's that's our angle super interesting and um I might I might pick it up then with with Yash obviously I'm sure there's a number of people in the audience have tried to change utility providers be it electricity or Internet and whatnot and trying to figure out how to they get the best performance for the lowest cost who do you believe to be the incumbents in your space and and and how are you thinking about your positioning yeah um so right now most people when you use an llm we're going to be using a single model right um and so it's it's kind of uh getting people to switch away from using that single model to having a kind of multimodel architecture one where they're able to switch between many different providers we can actually do routing for them right um I think the reason that you know sort of your your incumbent uh so your incumbents here who are these llm providers um are not going to get the best level of performance is because they're going to focus on on their own models right they're never going to route you away from their model to one of their competitors right and so if their competitor is doing something better you're never going to see that if you use only their platform Fair um and and makes makes a tremendous amount of sense and and last but not least Lars you know the the medical space how should we think about um you know the the medic IAL space solving this critical problem how should we think about the incumbents in your space I can talk for hours about this but but but I'll try to keep it uh brief into the point here I think that um what we're seeing a lot we're seeing a lot of companies that are trying to to to Embark in the healthcare space it's a difficult space to be in h so I'll I'll stick to the point of the ones that we see out there when we go out to the customers right um and I hope you catch my drift in terms with that right because there is a big difference here H and the ones we see out there are um are some of the bigger tech companies I think that one of the ones that I want to emphasize is is Nuance uh that has been there for a long time that is a dictation uh service normally they have also gone further than that in all due respect but are mostly known for the dictation software for doctors Etc and that's the ones that we're um competing the most with uh what we're we're having a slightly different route towards providing value to the client uh where we are going a little bit higher up the value chain in terms of predicting outcomes for these conversations so we're actually also having deployments where we are uh deployed next to news so it's it's it's it's a finicky space in terms of that and um that's how we try to get in and we try to be smart on maneuvering our way into the clients awesome um yeah I recall when we were spending time I think the one thing that we we also found when we were learning more about cord is is that for the doctors in the medical space pen and paper still see seems to be the predominant one but uh but Paul let me pass it back to you for for the second question yeah so you know for let's say all of the change we've seen in the in this space uh companies that are labeling themselves as AI companies there's a big difference between the companies that when we say AI companies that are really building their own AI Core technology it could be models could be data sets could be processes whatever and those that aren't and of course you know the reason you're here is because uh we believe you've built some of those core elements that uh uh make you different or set you apart I'd love to sort of understand Maybe your view what you know what are the things that uh that set you apart because you've built somei that without that you know your your company wouldn't be able to do what it what it it promises to do um maybe starting with um with Petro sure yeah you know from the beginning we um we've never really labeled ourselves as an AI company um we uh we we've positioned ourselves as an entertainment Innovation company using AI as the future of of of to to you know unlock these new formats that are coming um so we we went through as Paul knows we went through a big life cycle of prototyping using all sorts of differ we didn't know where things were going to land you know uh using music Transformers and reinforcement learning we put into a game and a film um large language models Etc so we don't uh we don't build core AI ourselves but we uh we're the glue that uh uh holds it together and translates from one generator to the next it's like um you know it's art meets science we're using the science to generate the art um I think that's a Pixar quote even uh letting the art no letting the tech Inspire the art and the art uh challenge the tech um so yeah that's that's been our approach is kind of like creating that entertainment Lego using different different models and and that keeps us fresh too because there's always something new yeah and I think uh to some extent when you say you're not building core AI technology I remember inter interacting with your interactive assets whether it's games or the director Studio it's very clear that you you know the way you connect these large language models to the unity engine and then bring that alive in a visual way is part of your your AI assets right it might be somebody say it's not your own model but I think that entire framework and making that come alive in a real time way right I mean you can see some of your things live on Twitch as you make these movies and people interact throwing bananas and so on I think that the you're uh I think you're under selling the AI stuff you guys well thank you I should plug uh to our our reinforcement learning game where we're letting people train neural networks right within the game itself that's a world first so yeah we we we certainly are creating core AI but just maybe a different approach than uh than some of these other AI companies thanks petro and um LS uh how would you think about your sort of core AI um components for that you know that make uh the way you solve the problem at Cy different from others yeah so so um we need to go through the entire stack from from understanding what's being said inside the audio um to um yeah speech representation learning speech recognition learning then natural language processing and then clinical predictions um that's basically what we have built upon since the beginning of our of our journey here and we build it from a process of saying hey we need to be on the frontier of science uh so we need to also take whatever ever paper is out there and replicate that model inside our own stack and reproduce the results of that uh of those models and go from an outline we we call it internally we call it a kill your dialing strategy here so so as soon as someone is coming up with a model like when the Transformer was coming out 2018 we found out that we needed to kill some of our lstm models maybe they're coming back again but that's a different more technical discussion um but um but so so basically we have tried to learn as much as possible from the research environment and then try to put some of these compon is inside our own modeling Paradigm and um so our core AI is they basically the entire value chain from the audio all the way to the clinical predictions and be able to do that in real time that's quite difficult because audio is difficult and uh we can do that in like predictions in less than a second and we do that quite complex uh input sources and also prediction sources great and maybe let me just before I I I go to to uh to Yash one thing that I think you know we had discussed Lars on this front is yes of course you've got because of your use case a real time need to be able to do this in you know emergency centers and so on to do the transcription the coding and support um so that's one thing that you guys really need to have built inous to make sure that works and we also looked at okay what's the uh what are the implications of some of these large powerful models that are coming out let's say GPD 4 that you could actually ask to do the tasks you guys are you know building in your into your commercial products can you comment a little bit because you shared some of the evaluations and we went back and forth on that how you see your ility to within that specific task within your domain based on the data sets you have to sort of build something that is more reliable safer at higher quality for that specific use case yeah I think that this is a perfect seg way to what yes is building right so if we had your your tool a little bit before then then we we could have utilized that quite quite heavily but we've done a lot of that PL making a lot of those Outlets to use your terminology um inhouse uh we we're friend believers in these more vertical models especially for a verticalized field like ours because we can get a lot out of that you can see some of the papers in terms of not B too much on that but some of the papers on being able to answer multiple choice medical QA questions uh when the model gets really good on that they decline on some some other things and that's basically our finding as well on our domain is that we can actually verticalized these models and then they become really really good at a cost of something else right we know that there will never be a pizza delivery call coming into our services and if it comes then then we don't need to help on that right and so so basically we can we we can we can specialize these model model quite heavily and what we basically do been doing is trying to take a lot of the llms out there specializing them fine tuning them restructuring them and so forth and also restructuring them in terms of the input modalities and talk for hours about that as well in terms of actually building that nicely so that we get something that is at a high Precision accuracy and and ensuring that that it can also run fast at a at a at a low cost right so awesome thanks for sharing that and then Yos uh you know you know you you you I think have hypothesized and we've talked about sort of the future where we'll have hundreds of thousands of llms and and and you so Mar and being the the you know the gateway to make that easy to choose which one how are you you know building AI into providing that capability to to for example ourselves right that are trying to make these choices on a day-to-day basis which model for which you case and so on yeah uh this is this is a question I love diving into the kind of like you know how are you actually doing this routing that um because the the fundamental sort of piece in routing is understanding these models right um in order to say okay we're going to send this request to this model you have to know what each model is good or bad at and that is often quite idios and crap right um you know these models hallucinate these models have all sorts of unknown behaviors right they're really really intricate machines and so what you have to do if you want to Route well um is really understand what those machines are doing right you have to basically understand them at a mechanistic level right how they work internally and so the core technology we're developing is actually understanding these Transformer models right you train them on a bunch of data you get this black box we are opening up that black box and we're doing this through a process which we're calling model mapping right the idea with model mapping here is to turn a transformer into a more interpretable representation to say okay Transformers are hard to study right there these big black boxes if we can turn them into something else first something which we can understand better then we can actually study them in more depth and that in-depth study lets us do routing better than any other company that possibly could right um the reason we're able to do this and actually part of the reason we started this company is that if you look at almost any other company they're often thinking of themselves as a kind of model provider right they're saying cool we're going to provide these models we're going to competition with other people we're going to build bigger and bigger models so when they raise funding it goes towards building bigger models right our approach is very different to say let's really understand these models deeply so that we can use them in more fundamentally interesting ways including for example routing and so that's the core technology we're building the ability to understand models rather than simply treat them as black boxes yeah and that's I think incredibly powerful um you youve built your own models do this in fact right it's a little bit uh meta in that way but uh you know the theme of this conference is lm's in production and uh you know we know from uh from a lot of the work we've done that you need to have this kind of intelligent model selection to go into production and going for larger uh always larger models isn't the either cost effective or uh or better best for the user experience so um thanks for sharing that over to you sandip no perfect well um just to to change change gears a little bit one of um one of the questions given the fact that the audience is predominantly you know people in that are ml practitioners and in in the field um just to share an anecdote from somebody in the Venture Capital Community I heard that I know some Junior people that are reaching out to every single person on LinkedIn at the moment that have anything to do with air ml in their LinkedIn bio so perhaps just wanted to get a flavor from from from the three of you around any tips or advice you can share with the the folks that are um in the audience at the moment on how best to engage with the Venture Community um to engage selectively not at all in in in detail perhaps starting with with Lars given um uh perhap given given the the scale of your business yeah yeah yeah um so um it's a difficult question right so let me try to um at least my my take on it is um it can be difficult to to to to manage all of the inbound I think that uh after this like uh like you have different waves of AI right now I follow some of the waves and I can always feel like on the inbound on LinkedIn that that that that you can feel the wave coming uh and I'm of course answering all of those inbound no no of course not so I think that um I think that uh um what one of the things that that I see as a really really good um uh way of engaging with the Venture Capital Community is is actually listening for a lot of the uh a lot of the competitive advice because a lot of Venture cap Community have a really really good um uh finger on the pulse in terms of the competition that they see out there in field and also competition on your business I I think just talking for myself but others can might feel it that my idea is better than anyone else's right or at least that that's feeling you know end up with right and actually um ping ponging a little bit more on the Venture Capital Community and and the venture capitalist in terms of facts you're finding out whether your idea is that brilliant and and getting some insights by asking enough questions back again in terms of actually finding out where you compet competition is that's something that I've really felt is is a good investment from my side um and it's something where we can actually get a lot of uh sentage checks right because a lot of things that are happening out the field everything can feel so amazing what people are doing out there and you can look at LinkedIn and everyone are a success right but uh scratching a little bit underneath the surface then you can also feel that other people are sitting with the same pains as yourself and it's good to it's good to use that the Venture capsule community in in that sense because a lot of people are actually using that as the 100% everyday job finding in terms of finding out scratching a little bit beneath the surface in terms finding out where people are are at this moment right so and Yos anything for you to add being in San in San Francisco in Silicon Valley yeah it's a good question um I think there's always this uh this temptation especially for newer Founders to you know sort of jump at the exciting things right and one of the things exciting when you're building a companies when other people start seeing you know what you're building and being interested by it seeing your vision um and so so you know when VCS are reaching out you can often feel like oh wow that's like you really cool thing and it is it is you should be excited by it right um at the same time you know the core of your business is to like go and build a business right um and so it's worth talking to folks who are you know really high intent who really like have conviction in what you're doing um and also getting to know folks uh more generally but I mean I know that uh like like we we really excited to have worked with proes because you guys are so high conviction right I feel like it gives us the ability to like go and focus on on building right um so I guess as a as a kind of like General um uh advice which of course would vary if you know we had more specifics about any any one person situation but as some kind of general advice I'd say um you know building is the most important thing um it's good to sort of get to know people in the field and and uh build relationships with people um but really focus on the folks who are highest conviction thank you uh Petra anything that you'd like to add from your perspective sure yeah yes I love that that that that word conviction that that's that's kind of my perspective too although we're you know we're early on our journey like we rised some preed two years ago uh and so I'm here to listen as much as I am to preach but I would say you know try to engage with future facing people if you have a future facing idea um and uh try not to get discouraged and fi find that conviction um you know shout out to Paul and and Euro when when we first sat down with them we were selling through an idea that might be five years out and a problem that didn't even exist yet and they uh they saw potential in it and that was um you know not everyone's going to see potential in your idea especially if you're solving a problem that's uh further out so um you know stay stay the course stay with your your vision and with the right people you know uh uh they can make the the magic happen awesome Paul back to you yeah given uh um given where we are on time and and also you know we've got uh I think today a few thousand people listening most most of the folks in the in the conference or the event are ml practitioners and I'm of the fundamental belief that in the next wave of AI companies uh we're going to be in need of Founders like yourselves that have a strong technical background that have a strong intuition with what uh you know wears the right time and space to you know deploy this technology in a safe way and an impactful way so I'd actually given you have you know maybe similar background to many of the folks listening maybe ask each of you for uh one piece of advice you wish you had known before starting your AI company that you'd like to share with folks here that hopefully will help them if they ever take the step in the same direction so uh maybe starting in the in the same order lar you wanna want to share some words one piece of advice oh if you have more feel free oh yeah yeah I think it's difficult to to get that I think that follow your conviction is is really good I learned from from you guys here don't be discouraged and and and stay sane there one piece of advice uh split in three right thanks for that Lis Yos yeah I would say that um because there's so many cool things going on in the field right now it's really important to focus on what gets you internally motivated right so um instead of looking at sort of oh external kind of of uh motivations look at what really gets you going internally that's uh I think that's important uh for everybody probably and especially if you're going to dedicate such an important part of your life to to a mission like founding a company and Petro how about you yeah when I look back I I kind of wish I knew what terms were going to come uh to be and uh so I could use those instead of taking a paragraph to explain it and then now gen AI boom that's the term so I would say like as you're inventing things really try to latch on to what what culture is calling what you're doing don't get stuck in in you know the way you used to explain it especially if you're uh inventing something um but yeah ultimately follow your conviction I guess I'm just going to um uh reflect what's been said before great follow do what you love and uh and don't get distracted by uh by let anyone else change what your conviction should be that's fantastic thank you guys for joining uh and sandip also thanks for joining the conversation and taking the time I know it's either very late or very early for some of you so I hope we get to conversation very soon again and uh now I'd like to maybe hand it over to Demitrius who's going to uh change the topic to uh something related to uh Mystic Wizards like gandal oh yes thou shal not [Music] pass
